# PhishMy.com
PhishMy.com is a lightweight web application designed to showcase how effortlessly users can be deceived by phishing emails that appear to originate from legitimate organizations. Use with caution: This tool is intended for educational purposes and should only be deployed in controlled, ethical environments. The current version is designed for local use but can be extended for deployment on a server to gather information about unsuspecting users—though this raises significant ethical and legal considerations.

• Setup Instructions
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Database Configuration: Set up a local database and configure the connection string in Visual Studio. This is necessary for the app to function properly.

2. Email Account Configuration: In the PhishApp.aspx.cs file, update the "mail" and "password" variables to provide the app with a valid email account. This email will be used to send phishing emails to the targeted users.

3. Phishing Templates: The app includes several pre-built phishing email templates that mimic legitimate communications. However, you have the option to customize these templates or add your own.

• Important Notes
Ethical Use: This project is part of a cybersecurity awareness initiative, and misuse could lead to legal consequences. The app is designed strictly for research, education, or controlled security testing purposes.
